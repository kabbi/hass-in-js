# Hass in JS

Do you dislike yaml? Do you think visual programming is not there yet? Just use JS! Like many things in life, home automation is better in JS.

```
npm install
cp .env.template .env
node supervisor.js
```

Put your token and hass url in `.env`, put your scripts in `./scripts`, see examples in `./examples`.
